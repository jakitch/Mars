            <em>The Industrial Superpower of Mars:</em> New Epsilon was founded in 2019 after its predecessor,
            Epsilon, went bankrupt and saw most of its residents move to Pi Country. Since its founding
            and restructure, New Epsilon has been booming and has the largest population of all the
            colonies at 1.5 million people. New Epsilon was made the capital of Mars in 2020 after the former
            capital, Pi Country, proved to be better off by focusing on exporting food to the other
            colonies and leaving the duties of delegating customs and interplanetary affairs to New Epsilon.

        <p class="article-text">
            <em>The First Mars Colony:</em> Since its founding in 2012, Pi Country has been the agricultural center
            of Mars. Before New Epsilon was founded, Pi Country was the most populous colony but its population
            has since died down to 500,000 due to an ongoing massive emigration to New Epsilon. Pi Country
            prides themselves in their famous marshan pies and is often visited by residents of New Epsilon 
            seeking vacation.

          <em>The Covenant Community of Mars:</em> Saint Omicron is home to believers of the Great Beyond. It is the
          smallest colony at 50,000 people and is very isolated from the rest of Mars. Saint Omicron
          is home to many temples and membership of the Galactic Community of the Great Beyond (GCGB) is mandatory
          for residents. Saint Omnicron is open to visitors, but proof of membership to the GCGB is required for those seeking to
          find a permanent home in Saint Omicron.
